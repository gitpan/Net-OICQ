Net/OICQ version 1.0

This module implements OICQ protocol, used by the instant messaging service
operated by Tencent Technology Limited, China.

INSTALLATION

In Version 0.8 and later, the encryption code is in a separate module named
Crypt::OICQ.  Please download and install Crypt::OICQ module first.

If you have installed version 0.7 or earlier version of Net::OICQ, please
uninstall the old version by running the following commands as root:

   find /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl -name OICQ -exec rm -r \{\} \;

or

   find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl -name OICQ -exec rm -r \{\} \;

To install Net::OICQ module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make test
   su
   make install

To install the console-only client type the following from the source directory:

   cp q /usr/local/bin/qq
   chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/qq

You can name the client file to whatever you like.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires Digest::MD5 perl module, which can be downloaded from CPAN
if it is not already installed on your system.

Net::OICQ also requires Crypt::OICQ, which used to be part of Net::OICQ and is
a separate module since Version 0.8 of Net::OICQ.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

FreeOICQ developers reverse-engineered Tencent's Win32 client code and
published their source codes on the Internet.  I would never be able to write
Net::OICQ without access to FreeOICQ source codes.

Chen Peng reverse-engineered the assembly codes created by FreeOICQ and kindly
made available his C source codes for the cipher used in OICQ.
