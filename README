Net-OICQ

This module implements OICQ protocol, used by the instant messaging service
operated by Tencent Technology Limited, China.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands in the source directory:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Or, you can use Makefile.PL if you have make command:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make test
    make install

A command-line QQ client named qq will be installed in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin
directory.  This program requires Term::ANSIColor and Term::ReadKey modules.


NOTE

If you have installed version 0.7 or earlier version of Net::OICQ, please
uninstall the old version by running the following commands as root:

   find /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl -name OICQ -exec rm -r \{\} \;

or

   find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl -name OICQ -exec rm -r \{\} \;


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires Digest::MD5 perl module, which can be downloaded from CPAN
if it is not already installed on your system.

Net::OICQ also requires Crypt::OICQ, which used to be part of Net::OICQ and is
a separate module since Version 0.8 of Net::OICQ.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

FreeOICQ developers reverse-engineered Tencent's Win32 client code and
published their source codes on the Internet.  I would never be able to write
Net::OICQ without access to FreeOICQ source codes.

Chen Peng reverse-engineered the assembly codes created by FreeOICQ and kindly
made available his C source codes for the cipher used in OICQ.
